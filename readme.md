Thanks, Dave Gray for helping me learn MERN and Redux
all this code is from the YouTube video with additional comments to help me understand the purpose and flow of all components provided by redux/react and custom one.
I have learned how to use the store, what API slices are, how they are connected to components and how they can be applied to make this code easier to understand. 
Compared to the Angular framework, I like how React is more focused on .js files, rather than having all three HTML, CSS, and JS files for each component
